Davie's Burger: the restaurant business has been booming and it is now looking to place a catchy advertisement in the local subway station.

-- 1
-- What are the column names?
SELECT * FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

-- 2 
-- How recent is this data?
SELECT DISTINCT order_date
from orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- 3
-- The special_instructions column stores the data where Davie’s Burgers customers leave a note for the kitchen or the delivery.
-- Instead of selecting all the columns using *, 
-- write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.

-- Limit the result to 20 rows.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
LIMIT 20;

-- 4 
--There seem to be a lot of empty values in that column. That is because customers sometimes leave the notes section blank.
-- Can you edit the query so that we are only 
-- returning the special instructions that are not empty?
SELECT special_instructions 
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL;

-- 5
-- Let’s go even further and sort the instructions 
-- in alphabetical order (A-Z).
SELECT special_instructions  
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

-- 6
-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

-- Are there any funny or interesting ones? 
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%sauce%';

-- 7
-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘door’.
-- Any funny or interesting ones?
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%door%';

-- 8
-- Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’.
-- Any funny or interesting ones?
SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';

-- 9
-- Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids.

-- For more readability:
-- Rename id as ‘#’
-- Rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’
SELECT id AS '#', 
   special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';
