Lyft Trip Data
Letâ€™s practice what we learned about joins by combining rows from different tables.

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

trips: trips information
riders: user data
cars: autonomous cars

--  ######## Write queries

SELECT * FROM trips;
 
SELECT * FROM riders;
 
SELECT * FROM cars;
 

 -- cross 
SELECT riders.first,
   riders.last,
   cars.model
FROM riders, cars;


-- Find the columns to join between trips and riders and combine the two tables using a LEFT JOIN.

SELECT *
FROM trips
LEFT JOIN riders 
  ON trips.rider_id = riders.id;

  --Suppose we want to create a link between the trips and the cars used during those trips.

--Find the columns to join on and combine the trips and cars table using an INNER JOIN.

SELECT *
FROM trips
INNER JOIN cars
  ON trips.car_id = cars.id;

-- The new riders data are in! There are three new users this month. Stack the riders table on top of the new table named riders2.

SELECT *
FROM riders
UNION
SELECT *
FROM riders2;
