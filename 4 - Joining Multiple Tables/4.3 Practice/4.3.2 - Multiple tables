Multiple Tables with Reddit
For this project, you’ll be working as a Data Analyst who will be examining some fictional data from Reddit, a social news aggregation, content rating site.

On Reddit, users can create posts with content such as text, media, and links to other websites. Users can post content to different communities known as subreddits, which focus on a particular topic. Users can then rate others’ content by upvoting or downvoting them, and each post will show its total cumulative score.

For this task you were given three tables:

users: users data
posts: posts information
subreddits: information about subreddits


4.
Write a few more queries to figure out the following information:

What user has the highest score?
What post has the highest score?
What are the top 5 subreddits with the highest subscriber_count?



SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'subreddit_count'
FROM subreddits;

SELECT username, MAX(score) AS 'highest_score'
FROM users;
 
SELECT title, MAX(score) AS 'highest_score'
FROM posts;
 
SELECT name
FROM subreddits
ORDER BY subscriber_count
LIMIT 5;

-- ######### Using Joins

-- Now let’s join the data from the different tables to find out some more information.

-- Use a LEFT JOIN with the users and posts tables to find out how many posts each user has made. Have the users table as the left table and order the data by the number of posts in descending order.
SELECT users.username, COUNT(*) AS 'posts_made'
FROM users
LEFT JOIN posts
  ON users.id = posts.id
GROUP BY users.id
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
