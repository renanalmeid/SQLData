################## ROW_NUMBER
Now that we have a good understanding of how to fetch data from different rows, letâ€™s explore how we can use window functions to order and rank our results.

The most straight-forward way to order our results is by using the ROW_NUMBER function which adds a sequential integer number to each row.

Adding a ROW_NUMBER to each row can be useful for seeing where in your result set the row falls.


SELECT 
   ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      ORDER BY streams_millions DESC
   ) AS 'row_num', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;

   --ORDER BY returns numeric values in ascending order (lowest to highest) by default, so row_num = 1 would be our lowest value.
