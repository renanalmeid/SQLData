###################RANK
Now that we understand how to use ROW_NUMBER, there is another function that is similar but provides an actual ranking: RANK.

If you were to modify your ROW_NUMBER query to use RANK instead, it might appear to be exactly the same at first glance. 
But if you look more closely, you can see that RANK will follow standard ranking rules so that when two values are the same, 
they will have the same rank whereas with ROW_NUMBER they would not.


SELECT 
   RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY week
      ORDER BY streams_millions DESC
   ) AS 'rank', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;
