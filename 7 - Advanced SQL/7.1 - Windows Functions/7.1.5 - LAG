##################LAG
Now that we understand how to pull the first or last value from our dataset and display it alongside our query results, let’s see how to fetch data from other parts of our results.
Window functions can use LAG or LEAD in order to access information from a row at a specified offset which comes before (LAG) or after (LEAD) the current row.

This means that by using LAG or LEAD you can access any row before or after the current row, which can be very useful in calculating the difference between the current and adjacent row. We will first focus on using LAG.


--- Select all
SELECT *
FROM streams;

--Let’s look at a window function that uses LAG. 
--We will look at the artist’s current number of streams and their streams from the previous week.

SELECT
   artist,
   week,
   streams_millions,
   LAG(streams_millions, 1, 0) OVER (
      ORDER BY week 
   ) previous_week_streams 
FROM
   streams 
WHERE
   artist = 'Lady Gaga';


LAG takes up to three arguments:

column (required)
offset (optional, default 1 row offset)
default (optional, what to replace default null values with)

-- Displaying the previous row value in each row can be useful, 
--but for our purposes let’s change our LAG function to instead show the change in streams for Lady Gaga per week

SELECT
   artist,
   week,
   streams_millions,
   streams_millions - LAG(streams_millions, 1, streams_millions) OVER ( 
      ORDER BY week 
   ) streams_millions_change
FROM
   streams 
WHERE
   artist = 'Lady Gaga';


-- Build upon our current query to use PARTITION BY to show the change in streams for “Lady Gaga” 
-- as well as the change in chart position.

SELECT
   artist,
   week,
   streams_millions,
   streams_millions - LAG(streams_millions, 1, streams_millions) OVER ( 
      PARTITION BY artist
      ORDER BY week 
   ) AS 'streams_millions_change',
   chart_position,
   LAG(chart_position, 1, chart_position) OVER ( 
      PARTITION BY artist
      ORDER BY week 
) - chart_position AS 'chart_position_change'
FROM
   streams
WHERE artist = 'Lady Gaga';
