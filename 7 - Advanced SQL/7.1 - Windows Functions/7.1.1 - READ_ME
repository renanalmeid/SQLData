Introduction to Window Functions
So far we’ve learned how to retrieve information from tables and perform calculations on them. But we’ve seen that GROUP BY and SUM reduce the number of rows in your query results because they are combining or grouping rows.

Window functions, on the other hand, allow you to maintain the values of your original table while displaying grouped or summative information alongside in another column. This is why many Data Scientists and Data Engineers love to use window functions for complex data analysis.

In this lesson, you will build upon the knowledge you’ve gained about aggregate functions and other clauses in order to write window functions.

--1) Run a query to select all the information in our social_media table to see what data we have.

SELECT *
FROM social_media;

--2) Delete the query and write a new query to return the username column and the SUM of the total change_in_followers in our social_media table, that are from “instagram”.

SELECT username, SUM(change_in_followers)
FROM social_media
WHERE username = 'instagram'
GROUP BY 1;

--3) Copy the following query to see the “running total” of Instagram’s change_in_followers for each month.
--A running total is the sum of all the previous rows up to the current one.
SELECT 
   month,
   change_in_followers,
   SUM(change_in_followers) OVER (
      ORDER BY month
   ) AS 'running_total'
FROM
   social_media
WHERE
   username = 'instagram';

-- SUM is only able to return one row of data that represents the sum of all months. running_total is able to show you what the total is after each month.
