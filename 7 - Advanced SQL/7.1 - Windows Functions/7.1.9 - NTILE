############## NTILE
The last window function we are going to learn is called NTILE and this can be used to find quartiles, 
quintiles or whatever ntile your data-driven heart desires.

NTILE allows you to break your data into roughly equal groups, based on what ntile you’d like:
 so if you were using quartile, it would divide the data into four groups (quarters).

When using NTILE you are required to provide a bucket, which represents the number 
of groups you’d like your data broken down into: NTILE(4) would be four “buckets” which would represent quartiles.

SELECT 
   NTILE(4) OVER (
     PARTITION BY week
      ORDER BY streams_millions DESC
   ) AS 'weekly_streams_group', 
   artist, 
   week,
   streams_millions
FROM
   streams;
