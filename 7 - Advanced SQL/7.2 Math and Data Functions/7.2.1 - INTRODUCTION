##########Introduction
In this lesson, we will introduce some math operators and functions to perform calculations on and convert values, along with a few date functions to transform, format, and extract information from dates.

Throughout the lesson, you will be working with the following tables containing mock data:

bakery: table storing information about orders made at a local bakery
guesses: table storing the values of a guessing game where the guessed value closest to a number wins
Hereâ€™s a quick preview of the concepts that will be covered in these next six exercises:

Math operators:

+ addition
- subtraction
\ division
* multiplication
% modulo (returns the remainder)
Math functions:

ABS(): returns the absolute value of the input expression
CAST(): converts an expression into another data type
Date and time functions:

DATETIME(): returns the date and time of a time string
DATE(): returns the date portion of a time string
TIME(): returns the time portion of a time string
STRFTIME(): returns a formatted date
