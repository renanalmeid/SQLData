###########Date and Time Functions III
The STRFTIME() function allows you to return a formatted date, as specified in a format string.

It has the following syntax:

STRFTIME(format, timestring, modifier1, modifier2, ...)
The first argument, format, is the format string.

The second argument is the timestring.

The remaining arguments are 0 or more optional modifiers to transform the time string.

Letâ€™s go into some more detail about the format string. The format string allows you to extract specific parts of the date and time. Recall the time string format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Each part of this time string can be extracted utilizing what are known as substitutions inside the format string.

The substitutions to extract each part of the date and time are the following:

%Y returns the year (YYYY)
%m returns the month (01-12)
%d returns the day of month (01-31)
%H returns the hour (00-23)
%M returns the minute (00-59)
%S returns the second (00-59)
For example, to extract the month and year of the current date,

SELECT STRFTIME('%m %Y', 'now');
And to extract just the current day,

SELECT STRFTIME('%d', 'now');

-- example

--The owners of the bakery want to find out what day most people placed orders.

--Use STRFTIME() with the COUNT() function to find out how many orders were made on each day.

SELECT strftime('%d', order_date) AS 'order_day',
  COUNT(*) 
FROM bakery 
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
