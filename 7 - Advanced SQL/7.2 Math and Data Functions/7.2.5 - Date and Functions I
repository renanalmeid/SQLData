Date and Time Functions I
SQL provides functions to work with dates.

In SQL, dates are typically written in one of the following formats:

Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Datetime or Timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss
These strings that represent dates are also known as time strings.

The DATETIME() function will return the entire time string which includes the date and time portions.

SELECT DATETIME('2020-09-01 17:38:22');
To obtain the current date and time, you can provide the string 'now' to the function, which returns the date and time in UTC.

SELECT DATETIME('now');
To obtain the date and time converted to your local timezone, you can provide a modifier localtime.

SELECT DATETIME('now', 'localtime');
The DATE() function allows us to extract just the date portion of a time string, which consists of the year, month and day.

SELECT DATE('2020-09-01 17:38:22'); -- 2020-09-01
The TIME() function allows us to extract just the time portion of a time string, which consists of the hour, minute and second.

SELECT TIME('2020-09-01 17:38:22'); -- 17:38:22


-- example

-- Write a query to select just the dates for each orderâ€™s order_date column from the bakery table.

SELECT DATE(order_date)
FROM bakery;
