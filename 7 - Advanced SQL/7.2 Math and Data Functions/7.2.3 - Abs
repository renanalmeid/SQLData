Abs
The ABS() function returns the absolute value of the input expression.

The absolute value of a number is the distance of that number from zero, taken as a positive value.]
 It can also be understood as the value of the number if we ignore its sign, such that negative values become positive, 
 and positive values remain the same.

For example,

SELECT ABS(-3); -- 3
SELECT ABS(5);  -- 5
Here, the absolute value of -3 is equal to 3, because it is 3 away from 0, and because ignoring the negative sign leaves 3.
 And, because 5 is a positive value, its absolute value remains 5.]

-- Example

A school holds an event every month where a glass jar is filled with jelly beans, and students can guess
 how many jelly beans are contained in the jar.
 Students who make the closest guess win a pack of new notebooks.

 SELECT first_name, ABS (guess-804)
FROM guesses;

-- Example 2
Find out the absolute value of the difference between the average guess of all students from the actual jelly bean count, which is 804.

Is the average guess close to the actual count?

SELECT ABS(AVG(guess) - 804)
FROM guesses;
