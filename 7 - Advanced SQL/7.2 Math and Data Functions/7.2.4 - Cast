#############Cast
The CAST() function is used to convert the value of an expression into another data type.

It has the following syntax:

SELECT CAST(expr AS type-name);
Here, expr is any expression that evaluates to a value, and type-name is the data type to convert that value into.

This function can be useful when performing calculations on values but we need to change their data types. For example, say that we want to divide two INTEGER numbers.

SELECT 3 / 2; -- 1
In the query above, the result would be rounded down to the nearest INTEGER number, 1, because 3 and 2 are both INTEGER values. Using CAST(), one of the values could be converted to a REAL so that the result is also of type REAL:

SELECT CAST(3 AS REAL) / 2; -- 1.5
In this query, CAST(3 AS REAL) will convert 3 to the REAL value 3.0. Then it will calculate 3.0 / 2 which equals to 1.5.

CAST() can also be used to convert TEXT values into a numerical value like REAL or INTEGER. When doing so, it will only consider any valid prefix at the beginning of the string that represents a numerical value.

For example,

SELECT CAST('3.14 is pi' AS REAL);
This query will convert the TEXT value '3.14 is pi' into type REAL, considering only the prefix '3.14' and ignoring ' is pi', resulting in 3.14.


-- example
--From the bakery table, we want to determine the final price of each order after the discount is applied. 

--However, the value of each discount is currently stored as TEXT, like '1.00 off', so you will need to convert them into numerical values.

--Utilize CAST() to convert the values of the discount column into REAL values. 
--Select the item_name column and the total cost of each order, after applying the discount for each item.

SELECT item_name, (price-CAST(discount AS REAL)) * quantity AS 'conta'
FROM bakery;
