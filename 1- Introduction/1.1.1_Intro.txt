-- SQL (pronounced “S-Q-L” or “sequel”) allows you to write queries which define the subset of data you are seeking.
-- Unlike Excel and Sheets, your computer and SQL will handle how to get the data; you can focus on what data you would like. You can save these queries, refine them, share them, and run them on different databases.

SELECT *
FROM browse
LIMIT 10;

--- Creating Usage Funnels 

-- Not all users who browse on the website will find something that they like enough to checkout, and not all users who begin the checkout process will finish entering their payment information to make a purchase.
--This type of multi-step process where some users leave at each step is called a funnel.

 SELECT ROUND(
   100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id) /
   COUNT(DISTINCT b.user_id)
 ) AS browse_to_checkout_percent,
 ROUND(
   100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT p.user_id) /
   COUNT(DISTINCT c.user_id)
 ) AS checkout_to_purchase_percent
 FROM browse b
 LEFT JOIN checkout c
 	ON b.user_id = c.user_id
 LEFT JOIN purchase p
 	ON c.user_id = p.user_id;


------- Analyzing User Churn

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS enrollments,
	COUNT(CASE
       	WHEN strftime("%m", cancel_date) = '03'
        THEN user_id
  END) AS march_cancellations,
 	ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE
       	WHEN strftime("%m", cancel_date) = '03'
        THEN user_id
  END) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)) AS churn_rate
FROM pro_users
WHERE signup_date < '2017-04-01'
	AND (
    (cancel_date IS NULL) OR
    (cancel_date > '2017-03-01')
  );


---- Web Traffic Attribution 

 SELECT utm_source,
 	COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS num_users
FROM page_visits
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
