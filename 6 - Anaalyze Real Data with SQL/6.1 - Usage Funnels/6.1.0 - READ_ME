What is a Funnel?
In the world of marketing analysis, “funnel” is a word you will hear time and time again.

A funnel is a marketing model which illustrates the theoretical customer journey towards the purchase of a product or service. Oftentimes, we want to track how many users complete a series of steps and know which steps have the most number of users giving up.

Some examples include:

Answering each part of a 5 question survey on customer satisfaction
Clicking “Continue” on each step of a set of 5 onboarding modals
Browsing a selection of products → Viewing a shopping cart → Making a purchase
Generally, we want to know the total number of users in each step of the funnel, as well as the percent of users who complete each step.

Throughout this lesson, we will be working with data from a fictional company called Mattresses and More. Using SQL, you can dive into complex funnels and event flow analysis to gain insights into their users’ behavior.
