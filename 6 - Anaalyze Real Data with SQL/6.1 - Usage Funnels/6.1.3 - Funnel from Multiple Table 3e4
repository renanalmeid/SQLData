First, add a column that counts the total number of rows in funnels.

Alias this column as ‘num_browse’.

This is the number of users in the “browse” step of the funnel.

WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse'
FROM funnels;

Second, add another column that sums the is_checkout in funnels.

Alias this column as ‘num_checkout’.

This is the number of users in the “checkout” step of the funnel.

WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse', 
  SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout'
FROM funnels;


---- Ex3
WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse', 
  SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout', 
  SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase', 
  1.0 * SUM(is_checkout) / COUNT(user_id) AS 'browse_to_checkout',
  1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_checkout) AS 'checkout_to_purchase'
FROM funnels;

Then, use GROUP BY so that we calculate num_browse, num_checkout, and num_purchase for each browse_date.

Also be sure to ORDER BY browse_date.

WITH funnels AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT b.browse_date,
     b.user_id,
     c.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_checkout',
     p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
  FROM browse AS 'b'
  LEFT JOIN checkout AS 'c'
    ON c.user_id = b.user_id
  LEFT JOIN purchase AS 'p'
    ON p.user_id = c.user_id)
SELECT browse_date,
   COUNT(*) AS 'num_browse',
   SUM(is_checkout) AS 'num_checkout',
   SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase',
   1.0 * SUM(is_checkout) / COUNT(user_id) AS 'browse_to_checkout',
   1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_checkout) AS 'checkout_to_purchase'
FROM funnels
GROUP BY browse_date
ORDER BY browse_date;
