########### Quizz Funnel 

 SELECT *
 FROM survey
 LIMIT 10;

 --Users will “give up” at different points in the survey. Let’s analyze how many users move from Question 1 to Question 2, etc. Create a quiz funnel using the GROUP BY command.

SELECT question, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM survey 
GROUP BY 1;

-- calculate the percentage of users who answer each question:
-- 1. 100
-- 2. 95
-- 3. 76
-- 4. 72.2
-- 5. 54


################# Home Try-On Funnel:
-- Take the Style Quiz → Home Try-On → Purchase the Perfect Pair of Glasses

-- Home Try-On Funnel
 
SELECT *
FROM quiz
LIMIT 5;
 user_id
style
fit
shape
color


SELECT *
FROM home_try_on
LIMIT 5;
 user_id
number_of_pairs
address


SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;
user_id
product_id
style
model_name
color
price


--- Ex 5
Each row will represent a single user from the browse table:

If the user has any entries in home_try_on, then is_home_try_on will be True.
number_of_pairs comes from home_try_on table
If the user has any entries in purchase, then is_purchase will be True.
Use a LEFT JOIN to combine the three tables, starting with the top of the funnel (quiz) and ending with the bottom of the funnel (purchase).

Select only the first 10 rows from this table (otherwise, the query will run really slowly).

SELECT DISTINCT q.user_id,
  h.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on',
  h.number_of_pairs,
  p.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'

FROM quiz q
LEFT JOIN home_try_on h
  ON q.user_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase p 
  ON p.user_id = q.user_id
LIMIT 10;
