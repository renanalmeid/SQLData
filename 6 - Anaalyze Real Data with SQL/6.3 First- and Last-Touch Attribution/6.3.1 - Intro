 ########## Introduction
Think of your favorite website: how did you find it? 
Did you use a search engine? Or click on an ad? Or follow a link in a blog post?

Web developers, marketers, and data analysts use that information to improve their sources (sometimes called channels or touchpoints) online. 
If an ad campaign drives a lot of visits to their site, then they know that source is working! We say that those visits are attributed to the ad campaign.

But how do websites capture that information? The answer is UTM parameters. 
These parameters capture when and how a user finds the site. Site owners use special links containing UTM parameters in their ads, blog posts, and other sources. 
When a user clicks one, a row is added to a database describing their page visit.

user_id - A unique identifier for each visitor to a page
timestamp - The time at which the visitor came to the page
page_name - The title of the section of the page that was visited
utm_source - Identifies which touchpoint sent the traffic (e.g. google, email, or facebook)
utm_medium - Identifies what type of link was used (e.g. cost-per-click or email)
utm_campaign - Identifies the specific ad or email blast (e.g. retargetting-ad or weekly-newsletter)
In this lesson, you will learn how to use SQL, UTM parameters, and touch attribution to draw insights from this data!

-- Example 1
SELECT *
FROM page_visits;


-- ##### First Touch Example
--Imagine June. She wants to buy a new t-shirt for her mother, who is visiting from out of town. 
--She reads about CoolTShirts.com in a Buzzfeed article, and clicks a link to their landing page.
--June finds a fabulous Ninja Turtle t-shirt and adds it to her cart. 
--Before she can advance to the checkout page her mom calls, asking for directions. 
--June navigates away from CoolTShirts.com to look up directions.
-- June’s initial visit is logged in the page_visits table as follows:

-- June’s first touch — the first time she was exposed to CoolTShirts.com — is attributed to buzzfeed
--June is assigned a user id of 10069
--She visited the landing page at 23:14:01 and the shopping cart at 23:55:01

-- Example 2
--Find June’s rows in the table! Select all columns from the page_visits table, using a WHERE clause with:

--user_id equals 10069 and
--utm_source equals 'buzzfeed'

SELECT *
FROM page_visits
WHERE ( 
  user_id = 10069 AND utm_source = 'buzzfeed'
);

-- ######### Last Touch Example

-- Find all of of June’s rows, using a WHERE clause with just user_id. 

-- Example 3
SELECT *
FROM page_visits 
WHERE user_id = 10069;


-- ######### First versus Last
If you want to increase sales at CoolTShirts.com, would you count on buzzfeed or increase facebook ads? The real question is: should June’s purchase be attributed to buzzfeed or to facebook?

There are two ways of analyzing this:

First-touch attribution only considers the first utm_source for each customer, which would be buzzfeed in this case. This is a good way of knowing how visitors initially discover a website.
Last-touch attribution only considers the last utm_source for each customer, which would be facebook in this case. This is a good way of knowing how visitors are drawn back to a website, especially for making a final purchase.

The results can be crucial to improving a company’s marketing and online presence. Most companies analyze both first- and last-touch attribution and display the results separately.


-- Example 4
--June’s sister also visited CoolTShirts.com!
--Select all columns from the page_visits table, using a WHERE clause with user_id = 10329.
--What are her first- and last-touch attributions?

SELECT *
FROM page_visits
WHERE user_id =10329;
