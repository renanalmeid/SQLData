What is Churn?
A common revenue model for SaaS (Software as a service) companies is to charge a monthly subscription fee for access to their product. Frequently, these companies aim to continually increase the number of users paying for their product. One metric that is helpful for this goal is churn rate.

Churn rate is the percent of subscribers that have canceled within a certain period, usually a month. For a user base to grow, the churn rate must be less than the new subscriber rate for the same period.

To calculate the churn rate, we only will be considering users who are subscribed at the beginning of the month. The churn rate is the number of these users who cancel during the month divided by the total number:

cancellations/total subscribers
