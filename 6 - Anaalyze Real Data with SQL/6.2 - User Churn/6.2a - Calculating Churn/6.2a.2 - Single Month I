-- ############# Single MonthI 

-- Typically, there will be data in a subscriptions table available in the following format:


-- Examples : numerator

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM subscriptions
WHERE subscription_start < '2016-12-01'
  AND (
    subscription_end
    BETWEEN '2016-12-01' AND '2016-12-31'
  );


  -- Example: denominator
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM subscriptions
WHERE subscription_start < '2016-12-01'
  AND (
    (subscription_end >= '2016-12-01')
    OR (subscription_end IS NULL)
  );


--When dividing, we need to be sure to multiply by 1.0 to cast the result as a float:

SELECT 1.0 * 
(
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM subscriptions
  WHERE subscription_start < '2016-12-01'
  AND (
    subscription_end
    BETWEEN '2016-12-01'
    AND '2016-12-31'
  )
) / (
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM subscriptions 
  WHERE subscription_start < '2016-12-01'
  AND (
    (subscription_end >= '2016-12-01')
    OR (subscription_end IS NULL)
  )
) 
AS result;
